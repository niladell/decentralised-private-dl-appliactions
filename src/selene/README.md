# Module running Selene in Federated Fashion
_This is a temporary setup just used for prototyping and fitting it into PySyft._

To run the module first download the data using `./manuscript/case1/download_data.sh`, then run `python run.sh`. It needs an environment with Selene and Syft (it has been tested with the "Quickfixed" version).
