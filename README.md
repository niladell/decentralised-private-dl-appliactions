# Federated learning and differential privacy in DL: healthcare applications
Nil Adell Mill

### Short project

In progress...

_Disclaimer: Altough this is something that is gonna be solved soon (I hope). As of today the current version of PySyft's federated learning breaks. I added a [dirty-fix here](https://github.com/niladell/PySyft/tree/dev-quickfix-cuda); you can also check [the original issue](https://github.com/OpenMined/PySyft/issues/1893) to see if there's any progress._
